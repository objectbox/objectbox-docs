# greenDAO Compat

Do you have an existing app that already uses the greenDAO library? We created DaoCompat as a compatibility layer that gives you a greenDAO like API, but behind the scenes uses ObjectBox to store your app's data.

Check out the [DaoCompat documentation](https://greenrobot.org/greendao/documentation/objectbox-compat/) on how to easily migrate your app to ObjectBox. There is also an [example app](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-examples/tree/main/android-app-daocompat) available.

Feel free to [ask for help on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/objectbox), or if you encounter a bug with DaoCompat [create an issue](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java/issues).
