# Desktop Apps

## ObjectBox – Embedded Database for Java Desktop Apps

Just like on Android, ObjectBox stands for a super simple API and high performance. It’s designed for objects and outperforms other database and ORM solutions. Because it is an embedded database, ObjectBox runs in your apps’ process and needs no maintenance. Read on to learn how to create a Java project using ObjectBox. We believe it’s fairly easy. Please let us know your thoughts on it.

## Setup and Usage

See the Getting Started page on how to set up your project, add entities and use the ObjectBox APIs.

## Examples

There are example command line apps available in [our examples repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-examples).

## Building Unit Tests

The setup and writing tests is identical to writing unit tests that run on the local JVM for Android, see [android-local-unit-tests.md](android/android-local-unit-tests.md "mention").
